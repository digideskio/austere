# Austere drupal theme

This set of files constitutes the Drupal theme used by Experience Bureau (www.experiencebureau.com) for the Austere website and online store project (www.austere.com.au).

These are the files/folders that live in sites/all

## Dependencies

### Base theme

This theme uses the clean base theme (http://drupal.org/project/clean)

### Modules

The folder structure for modules has been included in the repository but the source for most modules hasn't (i.e. just the folder structure)

The source for the following modules has been included because I either wrote them or hacked existing ones:

* uc_austere
* uc_removebutton
* uc_rm_productlinks
* uc_tc

### Libraries

* whizzywig
* phpmailer (only needed locally - for testing)
